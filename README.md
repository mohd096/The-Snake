# The Snake Game By Sayed Mohammed

## Game description

The goal of Snake is to create a snake as long as possible. This is achieved by guiding the
snake to an apple on the game board. The snake cannot stop moving, and dies whenever
it hits something (excluding apples). Because the snake is growing longer and longer as
the game progresses, it gets increasingly difficult to avoid collisions with the snake itself.
The player can change the direction of the head of the snake by using the arrow keys & (W,A,S,D) Keys. At
step in the game, there is always an apple somewhere on the board. If the snake eats an
apple, the snake becomes one cell longer per step, for 3 steps. A new apple bounce is placed on
a random location.
